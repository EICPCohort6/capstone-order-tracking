# Database and Analytics Team: Database Structure for an "Order Tracking" application

## Instructions: 
To create the database locally, do the following: 
  - Clone the repository to your local machine.
  - Open the SQL folder in a local instance of workbench.
  - Run the **capstone-project.sql** file to create the tables. 
  - Next, run the **insert_dummy_data.sql** file to insert mock data for testing. 


## Folder and File Structure:

In the **Backend** folder, there is the **SQL** folder in which there are 3 files. One to create the tables, one to insert the mock data and one that contains test queries as the following:

- BackEnd                 # Backend files 
  - Express              
  - Node              
  - SQL                   # Contains database files
    - capstone-project.sql                 # Contains Data Definition Language of the database
    - capstone-query-tests.sql             # Contains tests queries
    - insert_dummy_data.sql                # Contains dummy data. 
- FrontEnd                # Frontend files
    - CSS                 # CSS files 
    - HTML                # HTML files
